"I was born in Palo Alto CA and grew up in several cities as a youngster. My high school days took me out to Palm Desert where I earned my diploma, where I was the captain of the Varsity Water Polo team. I spent most of my free time, playing computer games, and daydreaming about my big bright future.",
"I have been a bartender in coastal San Diego for the last 14 years",
"I have been a commercial real estate broker",
